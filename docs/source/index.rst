Documentation of the OSeMOSYS Kenya PSM
========================================

The Kenya Power System Model (WESM) is a linear optimisation model of the Kenyan power sector, developed in OSeMOSYS. The model contains a detailed description of the sector, down to the single power plant level, and was originally developed by the Kenyan Least Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP) team in collaboration with researchers from the Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) project.

This documentation is intended to be model-specific, while a complete description of the OSeMOSYS modelling framework can be accessed at its `dedicated webpage <https://osemosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
